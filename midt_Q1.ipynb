        "    answer: The convolutional layer's output will take the following shape: (1, 12, 5, 5). The following dimensions of the output are projected: The number of output channels in this instance equals the number of out channels, which is 12. The following formula is used to calculate the output's spatial dimensions: (input size - kernel size + 2 * padding) / stride + 1. The outcome in this case is (5 = (10 - 4 + 2 * 1) / 2 + 1). So, the output tensor will be of the following shape: (1, 12, 5, 5).\n",
