A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. As a deep learning engineer, you are tasked to classify a dataset of X-ray images as either \"normal\", \"covid\" or \"viral pneumonia\". Use the chest X-ray dataset publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset to answer the following questions.\n"
